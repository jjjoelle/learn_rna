A Snakemake workflow for analyzing sequenced data. 


## Usage

The dataframe df contains the basename and paths for pair-end reads. We are currently using a specific genome and annotations for all reads in the dataframe. 

# TODO

* Replace `<owner>` and `<repo>` everywhere in the template (also under .github/workflows) with the correct `<repo>` name and owning user or organization.
* Replace `<name>` with the workflow name (can be the same as `<repo>`).
* Replace `<description>` with a description of what the workflow does.
* The workflow will occur in the snakemake-workflow-catalog once it has been made public. Then the link under "Usage" will point to the usage instructions if `<owner>` and `<repo>` were correctly set.
